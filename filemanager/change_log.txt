1.1 - Changes made by Christian Bloch (www.hdrlabs.com)
UBB code added and auto-select text on all code fields
support for spaces in filenames and capital extensions
included direct link encoding for subdirectories
(the > sign next to each folder gives you the link)
contributed a dark skin

1.0.2 - Fixed the display of swfs so that they display at the correct 
size, thanks to JesË™s Cuadra ( http://www.lavidadelosgorilas.org/ )
who pointed out that getimagesize works on swf files.

1.0.1 - Changed # hrefs to javascript:voids to stop jumping of the page 
in long file listings.

1.0 - search feature added, sorting of file display based on prefs,
nicer semantic xhtml markup with a lot of help from David Elstob 
(http://davidelstob.co.uk), script triggers moved to namespaced JS class.
Basically it should now be secure, fast and useful.
